                        <h1>My Expertise</h1>
                        
                        <p> I graduated with a degree in Busines from BYU Idaho. After that I took a job working for a consulting company working as a financial analyst.
                            From there I got accepted into a coding bootcamp in Austin, Texas and learned about object oriented programming. That led me to get a job at 
                            Dell EMC, where I worked there for one year as a business analyst. Nine months into that job I was invited to be a co-founder at a company called 
                            Zero To Ten, where I got to wear a bunch of hats over the next couple years. Through those experiences I've become a really good generalist in coding
                            Excel, Finance, Operations, Marketing, HR, Analytics, and other areas but not an expert. That is what led me to come back and get my MBA. Last summer 
                            I was able to secure an internship with SAP, which was an amazing expeince. I wish to build on that and on projects that are really adding value.
                        </p>
                        <p>After I graduate I will be joining AT&T in the FLDP program. The FLDP program is for emerging finance leaders, where they will go through 
                            three different rotations until they graduate, internally, from the program. After completion, I feel that I will have a lot of different
                            options. My main goal is to become a director of finance within 5 years. Sometime after that I would like to get back into entreprenuership.
                        </p>
                        <p>As far as my anticipated contributions in the field of finance, my main goal is to help shape decisions and strategies that create real value, not
                            just financial engineering. I want to be able to transition into small business and help them be able to navigate their cash flows and financing
                            so they are in the best position to be in control of their future.
                        </p>
